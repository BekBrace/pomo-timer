A terminal-based Pomodoro Timer application built in C that utilizes the **ncurses** library for a simple, interactive, and visually appealing Text User Interface (TUI). This project is part of Bek Brace's [Amir's] September project series.

## üöÄ Overview
The Pomodoro Timer is a time management tool based on the **Pomodoro Technique**, which encourages working in intervals (typically 25 minutes) separated by short breaks. This program allows users to:

- Set custom work and break intervals
- Start a countdown timer for both work and break sessions
- Receive notifications when the time is up, all within the terminal environment

## üåü Why This Project is Useful for C Beginners
This project is an excellent way to dive deeper into the C programming language, offering practical exposure to:

- **Text-based User Interfaces** using the `ncurses` library
- **Basic to Intermediate Programming Concepts** like loops, conditionals, and time management
- **Modular Programming** by organizing the code into functions

By working on this project, you'll gain hands-on experience in essential C concepts while also building a functional, real-world application.

## üõ†Ô∏è Features
- **Terminal User Interface (TUI)** using `ncurses`
- Customizable work and break intervals
- Real-time countdown timer
- Menu-driven system with easy navigation
- Visual enhancement with colored elements

## üìö What You Will Learn
### 1. Setting Up and Using `ncurses`
- Initializing ncurses, setting up the screen, handling special keys, and using colors
- Using functions like `initscr()`, `endwin()`, `cbreak()`, `noecho()`, `keypad()`, and `start_color()`

### 2. Creating a Simple User Interface
- Drawing menus, capturing user input, and creating a visually appealing interface with boxes and colors

### 3. Implementing a Timer
- Creating a countdown timer, updating the display in real-time, and managing time-based events

### 4. Handling User Input
- Using `getch()` to capture user input and implementing a menu system to navigate different options

### 5. Structured and Modular Programming
- Breaking down the program into smaller functions, making it easier to understand, maintain, and extend
